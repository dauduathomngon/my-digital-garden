## 1. *What is software engineering*
Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.
	- **Engineering discipline**: Engineers make things work. They apply theories, methods, and tools where these are appropriate. However, they use them selectively and always try to discover solutions to problems even when there are no applicable theories and methods. Engineers also recognize that they must work to organizational and financial constraints so they look for solutions within these constraints.
	- **All aspects of software production**: Software engineering is not just concerned with the technical processes of software development. It also includes activities such as software project management and the development of tools, methods, and theories to support software production

## 2. *Why software engineering important*
- More and more, individuals and society rely on advanced software systems. We need to be able to produce reliable and trustworthy systems economically and quickly
- It is usually cheaper, in the long run, to use software engineering methods and techniques for software systems rather than just write the programs as if it was a personal programming project. For most types of systems, the majority of costs are the costs of changing the software after it has gone into use

## 3. *What is software process*
The systematic approach that is used in software engineering is sometimes called a software process. A software process is a sequence of activities that leads to the production of a software product. There are four fundamental activities that are common to all software processes. These activities are:
	1. Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation. 
	2. Software development, where the software is designed and programmed. 
	3. Software validation, where the software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires. 
	4. Software evolution, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements
## 4. *What is the difference between software engineering and computer science*
>[!summary]
>Computer science focuses on theory and fundamentals; software engineering is concerned with the practicalities of developing and delivering useful software
- **Computer science** is concerned with the theories and methods that underlie computers and software systems, **whereas software engineering** is concerned with the practical problems of producing software. Some knowledge of computer science is essential for software engineers in the same way that some knowledge of physics is essential for electrical engineers. Computer science theory, however, is often most applicable to relatively small programs. Elegant theories of computer science cannot always be applied to large, complex problems that require a software solution.

## 5. *What are the goals of research in SE and what topics can we study ?*

The goal of SE is making a good software, so we want to research on what attributes make a software good.
- **Maintainability Software**: should be written in such a way so that it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers. This is a critical attribute because software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment. 
- **Dependability and security**: Software dependability includes a range of characteristics including reliability, security, and safety. Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure. Malicious users should not be able to access or damage the system.
- **Efficiency**: Software should not make wasteful use of system resources such as memory and processor cycles. Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, memory utilization, etc. 
- **Acceptability**: Software must be acceptable to the type of users for which it is designed. This means that it must be understandable, usable, and compatible with other systems that they use.
